- 👋 Hi, I’m sujitha darsi
- 👀 I’m interested in about innovating with code—from building efficient Java-based applications to exploring the endless possibilities of big data and AI.
      Whether it's designing smarter systems or transforming data into actionable insights, I thrive on making technology work for people.
- 🌱 I’m currently diving deep into Big Data and AI, learning how to make machines smarter (and maybe one day, make them laugh 😄).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on on projects that combine creativity with technology, whether it's a sleek web app, a machine learning model, or a data science project that uncovers hidden patterns.
      Let's build something amazing together!

- ⚡ Fun fact: When I’m not coding or designing drones to help farmers, you’ll find me staying active and competing in sports. I’m not just an engineer, I’m an athlete too! ⚽🏃‍♀️
